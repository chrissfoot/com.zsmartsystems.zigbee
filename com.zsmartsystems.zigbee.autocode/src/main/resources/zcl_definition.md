alarms may be generated.

#### BatteryVoltageMinThreshold Attribute
The BatteryVoltageMinThreshold attribute is 8-bits in length and specifies the low
voltage alarm threshold, measured in units of 100mV, for the BatteryVoltage
attribute. 

If the value of BatteryVoltage drops below the threshold specified by
BatteryVoltageMinThreshold an alarm shall be generated.

The Alarm Code field included in the generated alarm shall be 0x10.

If this attribute takes the value 0xff then this alarm shall not be generated.

## Identify [0x0003]
Attributes and commands to put a device into an Identification mode (e.g. flashing
a light), that indicates to an observer – e.g. an installer - which of several devices
it is, also to request any device that is identifying itself to respond to the initiator.

Note that this cluster cannot be disabled, and remains functional regardless of the
setting of the DeviceEnable attribute in the Basic cluster.

### Attributes

|Id     |Name                 |Type                       |Access     |Implement |Reporting |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------|----------|----------|
|0x0000 |IdentifyTime         |Unsigned 16-bit integer    |Read/Write |Mandatory |          |

#### IdentifyTime Attribute
The IdentifyTime attribute specifies the remaining length of time, in seconds, that
the device will continue to identify itself.

If this attribute is set to a value other than 0x0000 then the device shall enter its
identification procedure, in order to indicate to an observer which of several
devices it is. It is recommended that this procedure consists of flashing a light
with a period of 0.5 seconds. The IdentifyTime attribute shall be decremented
every second.

If this attribute reaches or is set to the value 0x0000 then the device shall
terminate its identification procedure.

### Received

#### Identify Command [0x00]
The identify command starts or stops the receiving device identifying itself.

## Groups [0x0004]
The ZigBee specification provides the capability for group addressing. That is,
any endpoint on any device may be assigned to one or more groups, each labeled
with a 16-bit identifier (0x0001 – 0xfff7), which acts for all intents and purposes
like a network address. Once a group is established, frames, sent using the
APSDE-DATA.request primitive and having a DstAddrMode of 0x01, denoting
group addressing, will be delivered to every endpoint assigned to the group
address named in the DstAddr parameter of the outgoing APSDE-DATA.request
primitive on every device in the network for which there are such endpoints.

Management of group membership on each device and endpoint is implemented
by the APS, but the over-the-air messages that allow for remote management and
commissioning of groups are defined here in the cluster library on the theory that,
while the basic group addressing facilities are integral to the operation of the
stack, not every device will need or want to implement this management cluster.
Furthermore, the placement of the management commands here allows developers
of proprietary profiles to avoid implementing the library cluster but still exploit
group addressing

## Scenes [0x0005]
The scenes cluster provides attributes and commands for setting up and recalling
scenes. Each scene corresponds to a set of stored values of specified attributes for
one or more clusters on the same end point as the scenes cluster.

In most cases scenes are associated with a particular group ID. Scenes may also
exist without a group, in which case the value 0x0000 replaces the group ID. Note
that extra care is required in these cases to avoid a scene ID collision, and that
commands related to scenes without a group may only be unicast, i.e.: they may
not be multicast or broadcast.

|0x0005 |LastConfiguredBy     |IEEE Address               |Read only  |Optional  |          |

#### SceneCount Attribute
The SceneCount attribute specifies the number of scenes currently in the device's
scene table.

#### CurrentScene Attribute
The CurrentScene attribute holds the Scene ID of the scene last invoked.

#### CurrentGroup Attribute
The CurrentGroup attribute holds the Group ID of the scene last invoked, or
0x0000 if the scene last invoked is not associated with a group.

#### SceneValid Attribute
The SceneValid attribute indicates whether the state of the device corresponds to
that associated with the CurrentScene and CurrentGroup attributes. TRUE
indicates that these attributes are valid, FALSE indicates that they are not valid.

Before a scene has been stored or recalled, this attribute is set to FALSE. After a
successful Store Scene or Recall Scene command it is set to TRUE. If, after a
scene is stored or recalled, the state of the device is modified, this attribute is set to
FALSE. 

#### NameSupport Attribute
The most significant bit of the NameSupport attribute indicates whether or not
scene names are supported. A value of 1 indicates that they are supported, and a
value of 0 indicates that they are not supported.

#### LastConfiguredBy Attribute
The LastConfiguredBy attribute is 64-bits in length and specifies the IEEE address
of the device that last configured the scene table.

The value 0xffffffffffffffff indicates that the device has not been configured, or
that the address of the device that last configured the scenes cluster is not known.

#### CurrentLevel Attribute
The CurrentLevel attribute represents the current level of this device. The
meaning of 'level' is device dependent. Value is between 0 and 254.

#### RemainingTime Attribute
The RemainingTime attribute represents the time remaining until the current
command is complete - it is specified in 1/10ths of a second. 

#### OnOffTransitionTime Attribute
The OnOffTransitionTime attribute represents the time taken to move to or from
the target level when On of Off commands are received by an On/Off cluster on
the same endpoint. It is specified in 1/10ths of a second.

The actual time taken should be as close to OnOffTransitionTime as the device is
able. N.B. If the device is not able to move at a variable rate, the
OnOffTransitionTime attribute should not be implemented. 

#### OnLevel Attribute
The OnLevel attribute determines the value that the CurrentLevel attribute is set to
when the OnOff attribute of an On/Off cluster on the same endpoint is set to On. If
the OnLevel attribute is not implemented, or is set to 0xff, it has no effect. 

#### OnTransitionTime Attribute
The OnTransitionTime attribute represents the time taken to move the current level from the
minimum level to the maximum level when an On command is received by an On/Off cluster on
the same endpoint.  It is specified in 10ths of a second.  If this command is not implemented,
or contains a value of 0xffff, the OnOffTransitionTime will be used instead.

#### OffTransitionTime Attribute
The OffTransitionTime attribute represents the time taken to move the current level from the
maximum level to the minimum level when an Off command is received by an On/Off cluster on
the same endpoint.  It is specified in 10ths of a second.  If this command is not implemented,
or contains a value of 0xffff, the OnOffTransitionTime will be used instead.

#### DefaultMoveRate Attribute
The DefaultMoveRate attribute determines the movement rate, in units per second, when a Move
command is received with a Rate parameter of 0xFF.

### Received

#### Move to Level Command [0x00]
On receipt of this command, a device SHALL move from its current level to the 
value given in the Level field. The meaning of ‘level’ is device dependent –e.g.,
for a light it MAY mean brightness level.The movement SHALL be as continuous as
technically practical, i.e., not a step function, and the time taken to move to
the new level SHALL be equal to the value of the Transition time field, in tenths
of a second, or as close to this as the device is able.If the Transition time field
takes the value 0xffff then the time taken to move to the new level SHALL instead
be determined by the OnOffTransitionTimeattribute. If OnOffTransitionTime, which is
an optional attribute, is not present, the device SHALL move to its new level as fast
as it is able.

## Alarms [0x0009]
Attributes and commands for sending alarm notifications and configuring alarm
functionality.

Alarm conditions and their respective alarm codes are described in individual
clusters, along with an alarm mask field. Where not masked, alarm notifications
are reported to subscribed targets using binding.

Where an alarm table is implemented, all alarms, masked or otherwise, are
recorded and may be retrieved on demand.

Alarms may either reset automatically when the conditions that cause are no
longer active, or may need to be explicitly reset.

#### AlarmCount Attribute
The AlarmCount attribute is 16-bits in length and specifies the number of entries
currently in the alarm table. This attribute shall be specified in the range 0x00 to
the maximum defined in the profile using this cluster.

If alarm logging is not implemented this attribute shall always take the value
0x00.

#### Alarm Command [0x00]
The alarm command signals an alarm situation on the sending device.

An alarm command is generated when a  cluster  which has alarm functionality detects an alarm
condition, e.g., an attribute has taken on a value that is outside a ‘safe’ range. The details
are given by individual cluster specifications.

#### Time Attribute
The Time attribute is 32-bits in length and holds the time value of a real time
clock. This attribute has data type UTCTime, but note that it may not actually be
synchronised to UTC - see discussion of the TimeStatus attribute below.

If the Master bit of the TimeStatus attribute has a value of 0, writing to this
attribute shall set the real time clock to the written value, otherwise it cannot be
written. The value 0xffffffff indicates an invalid time.

#### TimeStatus Attribute
The TimeStatus attribute holds a number of bit fields.

#### TimeZone Attribute
The TimeZone attribute indicates the local time zone, as a signed offset in seconds
from the Time attribute value. The value 0xffffffff indicates an invalid time zone. 

#### DstStart Attribute
The DstStart attribute indicates the DST start time in seconds. The value 0xffffffff
indicates an invalid DST start time.

#### DstEnd Attribute
The DstEnd attribute indicates the DST end time in seconds. The value 0xffffffff
indicates an invalid DST end time.

Note that the three attributes DstStart, DstEnd and DstShift are optional, but if any
one of them is implemented the other two must also be implemented.
Note that this attribute should be set to a new value once every year.

Note that this attribute should be set to a new value once every year, and should be
written synchronously with the DstStart attribute.

#### DstEnd Attribute
The DstEnd attribute indicates the DST end time in seconds. The value 0xffffffff
indicates an invalid DST end time.

Note that this attribute should be set to a new value once every year, and should be
written synchronously with the DstStart attribute

#### DstShift Attribute
The DstShift attribute represents a signed offset in seconds from the standard time,
to be applied between the times DstStart and DstEnd to calculate the Local Time.
The value 0xffffffff indicates an invalid DST shift.

The range of this attribute is +/- one day. Note that the actual range of DST values
employed by countries is much smaller than this, so the manufacturer has the
option to impose a smaller range. 

#### StandardTime Attribute
A device may derive the time by reading the Time and TimeZone attributes
and adding them together. If implemented however, the optional StandardTime
attribute indicates this time directly. The value 0xffffffff indicates an invalid
Standard Time. 

#### LocalTime Attribute
A device may derive the time by reading the Time, TimeZone, DstStart, DstEnd
and DstShift attributes and performing the calculation. If implemented however,
the optional LocalTime attribute indicates this time directly. The value 0xffffffff
indicates an invalid Local Time.

#### LocationType Attribute
The LocationType attribute is 8 bits long and is divided into bit fields.

#### LocationMethod Attribute

#### LocationAge Attribute
The LocationAge attribute indicates the amount of time, measured in seconds, that
has transpired since the location information was last calculated. This attribute is
not valid if the Absolute bit of the LocationType attribute is set to one. 

#### QualityMeasure Attribute
The QualityMeasure attribute is a measure of confidence in the corresponding
location information. The higher the value, the more confident the transmitting
device is in the location information. A value of 0x64 indicates complete (100%)
confidence and a value of 0x00 indicates zero confidence. (Note: no fixed
confidence metric is mandated – the metric may be application and manufacturer
dependent).

This field is not valid if the Absolute bit of the LocationType attribute is set to one. 

#### NumberOfDevices Attribute
The NumberOfDevices attribute is the number of devices whose location data
were used to calculate the last location value. This attribute is related to the
QualityMeasure attribute. 

#### Coordinate1 Attributes
The Coordinate1, Coordinate2 and Coordinate3 attributes are signed 16-bit
integers, and represent orthogonal linear coordinates x, y, z in meters as follows.

x = Coordinate1 / 10, y = Coordinate2 / 10, z = Coordinate3 / 10

The range of x is -3276.7 to 3276.7 meters, corresponding to Coordinate1
between 0x8001 and 0x7fff. The same range applies to y and z. A value of
0x8000 for any of the coordinates indicates that the coordinate is unknown.

#### Coordinate2 Attributes
The Coordinate1, Coordinate2 and Coordinate3 attributes are signed 16-bit
integers, and represent orthogonal linear coordinates x, y, z in meters as follows.

x = Coordinate1 / 10, y = Coordinate2 / 10, z = Coordinate3 / 10

The range of x is -3276.7 to 3276.7 meters, corresponding to Coordinate1
between 0x8001 and 0x7fff. The same range applies to y and z. A value of
0x8000 for any of the coordinates indicates that the coordinate is unknown.

#### Coordinate3 Attributes
The Coordinate1, Coordinate2 and Coordinate3 attributes are signed 16-bit
integers, and represent orthogonal linear coordinates x, y, z in meters as follows.

x = Coordinate1 / 10, y = Coordinate2 / 10, z = Coordinate3 / 10

The range of x is -3276.7 to 3276.7 meters, corresponding to Coordinate1
between 0x8001 and 0x7fff. The same range applies to y and z. A value of
0x8000 for any of the coordinates indicates that the coordinate is unknown.

#### Power Attribute
The Power attribute specifies the value of the average power P0, measured in
dBm, received at a reference distance of one meter from the transmitter.

P0 = Power / 100

A value of 0x8000 indicates that Power is unknown.

#### PathLossExponent Attribute
The PathLossExponent attribute specifies the value of the Path Loss Exponent n,
an exponent that describes the rate at which the signal power decays with
increasing distance from the transmitter.

n = PathLossExponent / 100

A value of 0xffff indicates that PathLossExponent is unknown.

#### ReportingPeriod Attribute
The ReportingPeriod attribute specifies the time in seconds between successive
reports of the device's location by means of the Location Data Notification
command. The minimum value this attribute can take is specified by the profile in
use. If ReportingPeriod is zero, the device does not automatically report its
location. Note that location information can always be polled at any time.

#### CalculationPeriod Attribute
The CalculationPeriod attribute specifies the time in seconds between successive
calculations of the device's location. If CalculationPeriod is less than the
physically possible minimum period that the calculation can be performed, the
calculation will be repeated as frequently as possible.

#### NumberRSSIMeasurements Attribute
The NumberRSSIMeasurements attribute specifies the number of RSSI
measurements to be used to generate one location estimate. The measurements are
averaged to improve accuracy. NumberRSSIMeasurements must be greater than or
equal to 1.

## Multistate Input (Basic) [0x0012]

The Multistate Input (Basic) cluster provides an interface for reading the value of a
multistate measurement and accessing various characteristics of that measurement. The
cluster is typically used to implement a sensor that measures a physical quantity that
can take on one of a number of discrete states.

#### StateText Attribute
This  attribute, of type Array of Character strings, holds descriptions of all possible
states of a multistate PresentValue.  The number of descriptions matches the number of states
defined in the NumberOfStates property. The PresentValue, interpreted as an integer, serves as
an index into the array. If the size of this array is changed, the NumberOfStates property SHALL
also be changed to the same value. The character set used SHALL be ASCII, and the attribute
SHALL contain a maximum of 16 characters, which SHALL be printable but are otherwise unrestricted.

#### Description Attribute
The Description attribute, of type Character string, MAY be used to hold a description
of the usage of the input, output or value, as appropriate to the cluster. The character
set used SHALL be ASCII, and the attribute SHALL contain a maximum of 16 characters,
which SHALL be printable but are otherwise unrestricted.

#### NumberOfStates Attribute
This attribute, of type Unsigned 16-bit integer, defines the number of states that a multistate
PresentValue MAY have. The NumberOfStates property SHALL always have a value greater than zero. 
If the value of this property is changed, the size of the StateText array, if present, SHALL also
be changed to the same value. The states are numbered consecutively, starting with 1.

#### OutOfService Attribute
The OutOfService attribute, of type Boolean, indicates whether (TRUE) or not (FALSE) the physical
input, output or value that the cluster represents is not in service. For an Input cluster, when
OutOfService is TRUE the PresentValue attribute is decoupled from the physical input and  will
not track changes to the  physical input. For an Output cluster, when OutOfService is TRUE the
PresentValue attribute is decoupled from the physical output, so changes to PresentValue will not
affect the physical output. For a Value cluster, when OutOfService is TRUE the PresentValue attribute
MAY be written to freely by software local to the device that the cluster resides on.

#### PresentValue Attribute
The PresentValue attribute indicates the current value of the input, output or
value, as appropriate  for the cluster. For Analog clusters it is of type single precision, for Binary
clusters it is of type  Boolean, and for multistate clusters it is of type Unsigned 16-bit integer. The
PresentValue attribute of an input cluster SHALL be writable when OutOfService is TRUE. When the PriorityArray
attribute is implemented, writing to PresentValue SHALL be equivalent to writing to element 16 of PriorityArray,
i.e., with a priority of 16.

#### Reliability Attribute
The Reliability attribute, of type 8-bit enumeration, provides an indication of whether
the PresentValueor the operation of the physical input, output or value in question (as
appropriate for the cluster) is “reliable” as far as can be determined and, if not, why
not. The Reliability attribute MAY have any of the following values:

NO-FAULT-DETECTED (0)
OVER-RANGE (2)
UNDER-RANGE (3)
OPEN-LOOP (4)
SHORTED-LOOP (5)
UNRELIABLE-OTHER (7)
PROCESS-ERROR (8)
MULTI-STATE-FAULT (9)
CONFIGURATION-ERROR (10)

|0x0009 |MULTI-STATE-FAULT         |
|0x000A |CONFIGURATION-ERROR       |

#### StatusFlags Attribute
This attribute, of type bitmap, represents four Boolean flags that indicate the general “health”
of the analog sensor. Three of the flags are associated with the values of other optional attributes
of this cluster. A more detailed status could be determined by reading the optional attributes (if
supported) that are linked to these flags. The relationship between individual flags is not defined. 

The four flags are Bit 0 = IN_ALARM, Bit 1 = FAULT, Bit 2 = OVERRIDDEN, Bit 3 = OUT OF SERVICE

where:

IN_ALARM -Logical FALSE (0) if the EventStateattribute has a value of NORMAL, otherwise logical TRUE (1).
This bit is always 0 unless the cluster implementing the EventState attribute is implemented on the same
endpoint.

FAULT -Logical TRUE (1) if the Reliability attribute is present and does not have a value of NO FAULT DETECTED,
otherwise logical FALSE (0).

OVERRIDDEN -Logical TRUE (1) if the cluster has been overridden by some  mechanism local to the device. 
Otherwise, the value is logical FALSE (0). In this context, for an input cluster, “overridden” is taken
to mean that the PresentValue and Reliability(optional) attributes are no longer tracking changes to the
physical input. For an Output cluster, “overridden” is taken to mean that the physical output is no longer
tracking changes to the PresentValue attribute and the Reliability attribute is no longer a reflection of
the physical output. For a Value cluster, “overridden” is taken to mean that the PresentValue attribute is
not writeable.

OUT OF SERVICE -Logical TRUE (1) if the OutOfService attribute has a value of TRUE, otherwise
logical FALSE (0).

|Id     |Name                      |
|-------|--------------------------|
|0x0001 |IN_ALARM                  |
|0x0002 |FAULT                     |
|0x0004 |OVERRIDDEN                |
|0x0008 |OUT OF SERVICE            |


#### ApplicationType Attribute
The ApplicationType attribute is an unsigned 32 bit integer that indicates the specific
application usage for this cluster. (Note: This attribute has no BACnet equivalent).
ApplicationType is subdivided into Group, Type and an Index number, as follows.

Group = Bits 24 -31 An indication of the cluster this attribute is part of.

Type = Bits 16 -23 For Analog clusters, the physical quantity that the Present Value attribute
of the cluster represents. For Binary and Multistate clusters, the application usage domain.

Index = Bits 0 -15The specific application usage of the cluster.

#### StateText Attribute
This  attribute, of type Array of Character strings, holds descriptions of all possible
states of a multistate PresentValue.  The number of descriptions matches the number of states
defined in the NumberOfStates property. The PresentValue, interpreted as an integer, serves as
an index into the array. If the size of this array is changed, the NumberOfStates property SHALL
also be changed to the same value. The character set used SHALL be ASCII, and the attribute
SHALL contain a maximum of 16 characters, which SHALL be printable but are otherwise unrestricted.

#### Description Attribute
The Description attribute, of type Character string, MAY be used to hold a description
of the usage of the input, output or value, as appropriate to the cluster. The character
set used SHALL be ASCII, and the attribute SHALL contain a maximum of 16 characters,
which SHALL be printable but are otherwise unrestricted.

#### NumberOfStates Attribute
This attribute, of type Unsigned 16-bit integer, defines the number of states that a multistate
PresentValue MAY have. The NumberOfStates property SHALL always have a value greater than zero. 
If the value of this property is changed, the size of the StateText array, if present, SHALL also
be changed to the same value. The states are numbered consecutively, starting with 1.

#### OutOfService Attribute
The OutOfService attribute, of type Boolean, indicates whether (TRUE) or not (FALSE) the physical
input, output or value that the cluster represents is not in service. For an Input cluster, when
OutOfService is TRUE the PresentValue attribute is decoupled from the physical input and  will
not track changes to the  physical input. For an Output cluster, when OutOfService is TRUE the
PresentValue attribute is decoupled from the physical output, so changes to PresentValue will not
affect the physical output. For a Value cluster, when OutOfService is TRUE the PresentValue attribute
MAY be written to freely by software local to the device that the cluster resides on.

#### PresentValue Attribute
The PresentValue attribute indicates the current value of the input, output or
value, as appropriate  for the cluster. For Analog clusters it is of type single precision, for Binary
clusters it is of type  Boolean, and for multistate clusters it is of type Unsigned 16-bit integer. The
PresentValue attribute of an input cluster SHALL be writable when OutOfService is TRUE. When the PriorityArray
attribute is implemented, writing to PresentValue SHALL be equivalent to writing to element 16 of PriorityArray,
i.e., with a priority of 16.

#### Reliability Attribute
The Reliability attribute, of type 8-bit enumeration, provides an indication of whether
the PresentValueor the operation of the physical input, output or value in question (as
appropriate for the cluster) is “reliable” as far as can be determined and, if not, why
not. The Reliability attribute MAY have any of the following values:

NO-FAULT-DETECTED (0)
OVER-RANGE (2)
UNDER-RANGE (3)
OPEN-LOOP (4)
SHORTED-LOOP (5)
UNRELIABLE-OTHER (7)
PROCESS-ERROR (8)
MULTI-STATE-FAULT (9)
CONFIGURATION-ERROR (10)

#### RelinquishDefault Attribute
The RelinquishDefault attribute is the default value to be used for the PresentValue
attribute when all elements of the PriorityArray attribute are marked as invalid.

#### StatusFlags Attribute
This attribute, of type bitmap, represents four Boolean flags that indicate the general “health”
of the analog sensor. Three of the flags are associated with the values of other optional attributes
of this cluster. A more detailed status could be determined by reading the optional attributes (if
supported) that are linked to these flags. The relationship between individual flags is not defined. 

The four flags are Bit 0 = IN_ALARM, Bit 1 = FAULT, Bit 2 = OVERRIDDEN, Bit 3 = OUT OF SERVICE

where:

IN_ALARM -Logical FALSE (0) if the EventStateattribute has a value of NORMAL, otherwise logical TRUE (1).
This bit is always 0 unless the cluster implementing the EventState attribute is implemented on the same
endpoint.

FAULT -Logical TRUE (1) if the Reliability attribute is present and does not have a value of NO FAULT DETECTED,
otherwise logical FALSE (0).

OVERRIDDEN -Logical TRUE (1) if the cluster has been overridden by some  mechanism local to the device. 
Otherwise, the value is logical FALSE (0). In this context, for an input cluster, “overridden” is taken
to mean that the PresentValue and Reliability(optional) attributes are no longer tracking changes to the
physical input. For an Output cluster, “overridden” is taken to mean that the physical output is no longer
tracking changes to the PresentValue attribute and the Reliability attribute is no longer a reflection of
the physical output. For a Value cluster, “overridden” is taken to mean that the PresentValue attribute is
not writeable.

OUT OF SERVICE -Logical TRUE (1) if the OutOfService attribute has a value of TRUE, otherwise
logical FALSE (0).

#### StateText Attribute
This  attribute, of type Array of Character strings, holds descriptions of all possible
states of a multistate PresentValue.  The number of descriptions matches the number of states
defined in the NumberOfStates property. The PresentValue, interpreted as an integer, serves as
an index into the array. If the size of this array is changed, the NumberOfStates property SHALL
also be changed to the same value. The character set used SHALL be ASCII, and the attribute
SHALL contain a maximum of 16 characters, which SHALL be printable but are otherwise unrestricted.

#### Description Attribute
The Description attribute, of type Character string, MAY be used to hold a description
of the usage of the input, output or value, as appropriate to the cluster. The character
set used SHALL be ASCII, and the attribute SHALL contain a maximum of 16 characters,
which SHALL be printable but are otherwise unrestricted.

#### NumberOfStates Attribute
This attribute, of type Unsigned 16-bit integer, defines the number of states that a multistate
PresentValue MAY have. The NumberOfStates property SHALL always have a value greater than zero. 
If the value of this property is changed, the size of the StateText array, if present, SHALL also
be changed to the same value. The states are numbered consecutively, starting with 1.

#### OutOfService Attribute
The OutOfService attribute, of type Boolean, indicates whether (TRUE) or not (FALSE) the physical
input, output or value that the cluster represents is not in service. For an Input cluster, when
OutOfService is TRUE the PresentValue attribute is decoupled from the physical input and  will
not track changes to the  physical input. For an Output cluster, when OutOfService is TRUE the
PresentValue attribute is decoupled from the physical output, so changes to PresentValue will not
affect the physical output. For a Value cluster, when OutOfService is TRUE the PresentValue attribute
MAY be written to freely by software local to the device that the cluster resides on.

#### PresentValue Attribute
The PresentValue attribute indicates the current value of the input, output or
value, as appropriate for the cluster. For Analog clusters it is of type single precision, for Binary
clusters it is of type  Boolean, and for multistate clusters it is of type Unsigned 16-bit integer. The
PresentValue attribute of an input cluster SHALL be writable when OutOfService is TRUE. When the PriorityArray
attribute is implemented, writing to PresentValue SHALL be equivalent to writing to element 16 of PriorityArray,
i.e., with a priority of 16.

#### Reliability Attribute
The Reliability attribute, of type 8-bit enumeration, provides an indication of whether
the PresentValueor the operation of the physical input, output or value in question (as
appropriate for the cluster) is “reliable” as far as can be determined and, if not, why
not. The Reliability attribute MAY have any of the following values:

NO-FAULT-DETECTED (0)
OVER-RANGE (2)
UNDER-RANGE (3)
OPEN-LOOP (4)
SHORTED-LOOP (5)
UNRELIABLE-OTHER (7)
PROCESS-ERROR (8)

#### RelinquishDefault Attribute
The RelinquishDefault attribute is the default value to be used for the PresentValue
attribute when all elements of the PriorityArray attribute are marked as invalid.

#### StatusFlags Attribute
This attribute, of type bitmap, represents four Boolean flags that indicate the general “health”
of the analog sensor. Three of the flags are associated with the values of other optional attributes
of this cluster. A more detailed status could be determined by reading the optional attributes (if
supported) that are linked to these flags. The relationship between individual flags is not defined. 

The four flags are Bit 0 = IN_ALARM, Bit 1 = FAULT, Bit 2 = OVERRIDDEN, Bit 3 = OUT OF SERVICE

where:

IN_ALARM -Logical FALSE (0) if the EventStateattribute has a value of NORMAL, otherwise logical TRUE (1).
This bit is always 0 unless the cluster implementing the EventState attribute is implemented on the same
endpoint.

FAULT -Logical TRUE (1) if the Reliability attribute is present and does not have a value of NO FAULT DETECTED,
otherwise logical FALSE (0).

OVERRIDDEN -Logical TRUE (1) if the cluster has been overridden by some  mechanism local to the device. 
Otherwise, the value is logical FALSE (0). In this context, for an input cluster, “overridden” is taken
to mean that the PresentValue and Reliability(optional) attributes are no longer tracking changes to the
physical input. For an Output cluster, “overridden” is taken to mean that the physical output is no longer
tracking changes to the PresentValue attribute and the Reliability attribute is no longer a reflection of
the physical output. For a Value cluster, “overridden” is taken to mean that the PresentValue attribute is
not writeable.

OUT OF SERVICE -Logical TRUE (1) if the OutOfService attribute has a value of TRUE, otherwise
logical FALSE (0).

#### Set Weekly Schedule [0x01]

The set weekly schedule command is used to update the thermostat weekly set point schedule from a management system.
If the thermostat already has a weekly set point schedule programmed then it SHOULD replace each daily set point set
as it receives the updates from the management system. For example if the thermostat has 4 set points for every day of
the week and is sent a Set Weekly Schedule command with one set point for Saturday then the thermostat SHOULD remove
all 4 set points for Saturday and replace those with the updated set point but leave all other days unchanged.

If the schedule is larger than what fits in one ZigBee frame or contains more than 10 transitions, the schedule SHALL
then be sent using multipleSet Weekly Schedule Commands.

#### Clear Weekly Schedule [0x03]

#### Get Relay Status Log [0x04]

The Get Relay Status Log command is used to query the thermostat internal relay status log. This command has no payload.

The log storing order is First in First Out (FIFO) when the log is generated and stored into the Queue.

The first record in the log (i.e., the oldest) one, is the first to be replaced when there is a new record and there is
no more space in the log. Thus, the newest record will overwrite the oldest one if there is no space left.

The log storing order is Last In First Out (LIFO) when the log is being retrieved from the Queue by a client device.
Once the "Get Relay Status Log Response" frame is sent by the Server, the "Unread Entries" attribute
SHOULD be decremented to indicate the number of unread records that remain in the queue.

If the "Unread Entries"attribute reaches zero and the Client sends a new "Get Relay Status Log Request", the Server
MAY send one of the following items as a response:

i) resend the last Get Relay Status Log Response
or
ii) generate new log record at the time of request and send Get Relay Status Log Response with the new data

#### CurrentHue Attribute
The CurrentHue attribute contains the current hue value of the light. It is updated
as fast as practical during commands that change the hue.

The hue in degrees shall be related to the CurrentHue attribute by the relationship
Hue = CurrentHue x 360 / 254 (CurrentHue in the range 0 - 254 inclusive)

If this attribute is implemented then the CurrentSaturation and ColorMode
attributes shall also be implemented.

#### CurrentSaturation Attribute
The CurrentSaturation attribute holds the current saturation value of the light. It is
updated as fast as practical during commands that change the saturation.
The saturation shall be related to the CurrentSaturation attribute by the
relationship
Saturation = CurrentSaturation/254 (CurrentSaturation in the range 0 - 254 inclusive)
If this attribute is implemented then the CurrentHue and ColorMode attributes
shall also be implemented.

#### RemainingTime Attribute
The RemainingTime attribute holds the time remaining, in 1/10ths of a second,
until the currently active command will be complete.

#### CurrentX Attribute
The CurrentX attribute contains the current value of the normalized chromaticity
value x, as defined in the CIE xyY Color Space. It is updated as fast as practical
during commands that change the color.

The value of x shall be related to the CurrentX attribute by the relationship

x = CurrentX / 65535 (CurrentX in the range 0 to 65279 inclusive)

#### CurrentY Attribute
The CurrentY attribute contains the current value of the normalized chromaticity
value y, as defined in the CIE xyY Color Space. It is updated as fast as practical
during commands that change the color.

The value of y shall be related to the CurrentY attribute by the relationship

y = CurrentY / 65535 (CurrentY in the range 0 to 65279 inclusive)

#### DriftCompensation Attribute
The DriftCompensation attribute indicates what mechanism, if any, is in use for
compensation for color/intensity drift over time.

#### CompensationText Attribute
The CompensationText attribute holds a textual indication of what mechanism, if
any, is in use to compensate for color/intensity drift over time.

#### ColorTemperature Attribute
The ColorTemperature attribute contains a scaled inverse of the current value of
the color temperature. It is updated as fast as practical during commands that
change the color.

The color temperature value in Kelvins shall be related to the ColorTemperature
attribute by the relationship

Color temperature = 1,000,000 / ColorTemperature (ColorTemperature in the
range 1 to 65279 inclusive, giving a color temperature range from 1,000,000
Kelvins to 15.32 Kelvins).

The value ColorTemperature = 0 indicates an undefined value. The value
ColorTemperature = 65535 indicates an invalid value. 

#### ColorMode Attribute
The ColorMode attribute indicates which attributes are currently determining the color of the device.
If either the CurrentHue or CurrentSaturation attribute is implemented, this attribute SHALL also be
implemented, otherwise it is optional. The value of the ColorMode attribute cannot be written directly
- it is set upon reception of another command in to the appropriate mode for that command.

#### EnhancedCurrentHue Attribute
The EnhancedCurrentHueattribute represents non-equidistant steps along the CIE 1931 color
triangle, and it provides 16-bits precision. The upper 8 bits of this attribute SHALL be
used as an index in the implementation specific XY lookup table to provide the non-equidistance
steps (see the ZLL test specification for an example).  The lower 8 bits SHALL be used to
interpolate between these steps in a linear way in order to provide color zoom for the user.

#### EnhancedColorMode Attribute
The EnhancedColorModeattribute specifies which attributes are currently determining the color of the device.
To provide compatibility with standard ZCL, the original ColorModeattribute SHALLindicate ‘CurrentHueand CurrentSaturation’
when the light uses the EnhancedCurrentHueattribute.

has the value 0x01, the color loop SHALL be active. All other values (0x02 – 0xff) are reserved.

#### ColorLoopDirection Attribute
The ColorLoopDirection attribute specifies the current direction of the color loop.
If this attribute has the value 0x00, the EnhancedCurrentHue attribute SHALL be decremented.
If this attribute has the value 0x01, the EnhancedCurrentHue attribute SHALL be incremented.
All other values (0x02 – 0xff) are reserved.

#### ColorLoopTime Attribute
The ColorLoopTime attribute specifies the number of seconds it SHALL take to perform a full
color loop, i.e.,to cycle all values of the EnhancedCurrentHue attribute (between 0x0000 and 0xffff).

#### ColorLoopStartHue Attribute
The ColorLoopStartEnhancedHueattribute specifies the value of the EnhancedCurrentHue attribute
from which the color loop SHALL be started.

#### ColorLoopStoredHue Attribute
The ColorLoopStoredEnhancedHue attribute specifies the value of the EnhancedCurrentHue attribute
before the color loop was started. Once the color loop is complete, the EnhancedCurrentHue
attribute SHALL be restored to this value.

#### ColorTemperatureMin Attribute

#### ZoneStatus Attribute
The ZoneStatus attribute is a bit map. Each bit defines the state of an alarm.

#### IASCIEAddress Attribute
The IAS_CIE_Address attribute specifies the address that commands generated by
the server shall be sent to. All commands received by the server must also come
from this address.

It is up to the zone's specific implementation to permit or deny change (write) of
this attribute at specific times. Also, it is up to the zone's specific implementation
to implement some auto-detect for the CIE (example: by requesting the ZigBee
cluster discovery service to locate a Zone Server cluster.) or require the
intervention of a CT in order to configure this attribute during installation.

## Electrical Measurement [0x0B04]
This cluster provides a mechanism for querying data about the electrical properties as measured
by the device. This cluster may be implemented on any device type and be implemented on a per-endpoint
basis. For example, a power  strip device could represent each outlet on a  different endpoint and
report electrical  information for each individual outlet. The only caveat is that if you implement
an attribute that has an associated multiplier and divisor, then you must implement the associated
multiplier and divisor attributes. For example if you implement DCVoltage, you must also implement
DCVoltageMultiplier and DCVoltageDivisor.

If you are interested in reading information about the power supply or battery level on the device,
please see the Power Configuration cluster.
